    <h2>What's a web ring?</h2>

    <p>A web ring is a collection of websites connected together via embedded
    links. The name "ring" comes from the fact that the connected websites form
    a circular loop that you can navigate over and over again by pressing
    "next." They were popular in the '90s but got extinct in the 2000s. But not
    this one, as you can see, since it was built in the 2020s for the sole
    purpose of resurrecting the old tradition.</p>

    <h2>How's this ring different from other ones?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The ring contains exclusively fucked up websites with questionable
        content and of questionable purpose.</li>
        <li>Instead of making the navigation as obvious as possible, the links
        to the next/previous page are hidden on each website to make it more
        interesting. Well, except this one because it'd be kinda awkward
        otherwise.</li>
        <li>If hiding a web ring widget on your website isn't hidden enough for
        you, you can also make your website accessible only when navigating
        backward/forward.</li>
        <li>The ring is powered by the state of art cutting edge
        <s>blockchain</s> serverless technology also known as a JavaScript
        library that parses a JSON file.</li>
        <li>The members of the ring get a 25% discount for their first purchase
        of a Bruh, Ltd Official Portable Toilet™.</li>
    </ul>
